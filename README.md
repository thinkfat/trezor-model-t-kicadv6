# trezor-model-t-kicadv6

This is an adaptation of the official Trezor Model T PCB to KiCAD. 
It was created in response to an EEVBlog episode where Dave tested
whether releasing the PCB CAD files (instead of Gerber files) for 
an Open Hardware project was enough to actually recreate the PCB.

This is not a ready-to-manufacture project. It is also not identical
to the genuine Trezor T PCB. Several changes have been made by myself to
loosen the manufacturing constraints of the PCB and improve the routing
for EMC compliance.

This PCB has never been actually manufactured. Use it on your own risk 
as a starting point to make your own Trezor Model T.

I have neither plans or intention to continue this work.
